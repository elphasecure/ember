<filename>.python.out - generated by running "../test-old-features.py <filename>"
The program generates a few extra lines of output so you'll want to open the output
file and remove the first few lines, leaving only the json. test-old-features provides
the output that the ember python lib would provide by default

<filename>.lief-output - generated on the agent side, you'll need to generate this
for every file you want to run the transformation code on

<filename>.newfeatures.out - generated by the new code that converts the agent's lief
output to the ember format. "../test-new-features.py <filename>.lief-output

To check that the individual features are correct, you can extract them from
the old/new output and compare them. For example to look at the exports.
1.
../test-old-features.py libcurl-4.dll > libcurl-4.dll.python.out
# edit sav and remove the extra lines
jq .export < libcurl-4.dll.python.out > export.orig

2.
# make sure you generate libcurl-4.dll-lief-output with the agent
../test-new-features.py libcurl-4.dl-lief-output > libcurl-4.dll.new.out
jq .export < libcurl-4.dll.new.out > export.new

3.
diff export.orig export.new
